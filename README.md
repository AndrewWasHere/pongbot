# Pongbot

"Bounce" a Zumo32U4 sumobot off the boundaries of a sumobot ring.

This is a proof-of-concept for using my 
[state machine library](https://github.com/AndrewWasHere/statemachine-arduino) 
on an Arduino.

Zumo32U4 sumobot available from 
[Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/category/170/zumo-32u4-robot).
